// In C++, the "this" keyword refers to a pointer that holds the memory address of the current object
// instance within a member function of that object's class. It allows you to access members and
// methods of the current object within its own methods. "this" is particularly useful when you have
// local variables or parameters with the same names as member variables, as it helps differentiate
// between them. By using "this", you can explicitly specify that you are referring to the member
// variables of the current object.
